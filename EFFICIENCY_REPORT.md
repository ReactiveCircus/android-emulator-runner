# Android Emulator Runner - Efficiency Improvements Report

## Overview
This report documents efficiency improvements identified in the Android Emulator Runner codebase. The analysis focused on finding opportunities to reduce redundant operations, optimize I/O, and improve overall performance.

## Identified Inefficiencies

### 1. Multiple Shell Executions for Config.ini Updates (HIGH IMPACT) âš¡
**File:** `src/emulator-manager.ts` (Lines 40-58)
**Issue:** The code executes up to 5 separate shell commands to append configuration entries to the AVD config.ini file.
**Impact:** Each shell execution spawns a new process, which is expensive. When multiple config options are set, this results in 5 separate process spawns.
**Solution:** Batch all configuration entries into a single shell command.
**Performance Gain:** Reduces shell executions from 5 to 1 (up to 80% reduction in process spawns).

### 2. Inefficient Channel Mapping (MEDIUM IMPACT)
**File:** `src/channel-id-mapper.ts` (Lines 1-13)
**Issue:** Uses if-else chain instead of a lookup table/map for channel name to ID mapping.
**Impact:** O(n) lookup time instead of O(1), though with only 4 channels the impact is minimal.
**Solution:** Replace with a Map or object lookup.
**Performance Gain:** Constant time lookup instead of linear search.

### 3. Repeated Number Conversions (LOW IMPACT)
**File:** `src/input-validator.ts` (Lines 79, 92, 97)
**Issue:** The `checkEmulatorBuild` and `checkDiskSize` functions call `Number()` multiple times on the same string.
**Impact:** Unnecessary computation overhead.
**Solution:** Store the converted number in a variable and reuse it.
**Performance Gain:** Eliminates redundant type conversions.

### 4. Regex Creation on Every Function Call (LOW IMPACT)
**File:** `src/script-parser.ts` (Line 7)
**Issue:** Creates regex `/\r\n|\n|\r/` on every `parseScript` function call.
**Impact:** Regex compilation overhead on each invocation.
**Solution:** Define regex as a module-level constant.
**Performance Gain:** Eliminates regex recompilation.

### 5. Redundant Boolean Validation Functions (LOW IMPACT)
**File:** `src/input-validator.ts` (Lines 39-76)
**Issue:** Multiple similar validation functions that all use the same `isValidBoolean` helper.
**Impact:** Code duplication and maintenance overhead.
**Solution:** Create a generic boolean validator function.
**Performance Gain:** Reduced code size and improved maintainability.

## Implementation Priority

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Config.ini shell execution batching (implemented in this PR)
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Channel mapping optimization
3. **LOW PRIORITY:** Number conversion optimization
4. **LOW PRIORITY:** Regex constant optimization
5. **LOW PRIORITY:** Boolean validation consolidation

## Performance Impact Summary

The primary fix implemented in this PR (batching config.ini updates) provides the most significant performance improvement by reducing shell process spawns from up to 5 to 1. This is particularly beneficial when multiple AVD configuration options are specified, which is a common use case.

The other identified inefficiencies have lower impact but could be addressed in future optimization efforts for marginal performance gains and improved code maintainability.

## Testing

All existing tests pass with the implemented changes, ensuring no functional regressions while providing performance benefits.
